SHORTNOTES FOR EACH QUESTION
88 - Merge Sorted Array -> 2 pointer
27 - Remove Element -> 2 pointer
26 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array -> set
                                         -> 2 pointer
80 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II -> 2 pointer
189 - Rotate Array -> slicing
                   -> reverse
169 - Majority Element -> sort 
                       -> dictionary
                       -> majrity element ,so will always remain in lead
121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock -> minimum buy price, maximum profit
122 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II -> greedy(sell at increase)
55 - Jump Game -> keep a carry to tell which index is accessible
274 -  H-Index -> sorting
380 - Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) -> use list
238 - Product of Array Except Self -> use prefix and postfix array (without division)
                                   -> count zeroes (0 then total_product/current number 1 then all number 0 and zero will have product of remaing if 2 or more then all zeroes)
134 - Gas Station -> if total negative then -1 else will have definetly a solution so whenever negative index should be i+1 
135 - Candy -> check if left neighbour is smaller than increase candy for right neighbour then iterate backwords and check max value of current candies and right nieghbour candy +1
